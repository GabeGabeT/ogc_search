# ogc_search
Django based search for the Canadian Open Government Portal 

This project uses a Django framework web application as a thin frontend to Solr to do searching of datasets and proactive disclosure data 
for the Open Government Portal. Instead of using the usual CKAN Solr 6 cores, data is loaded into custom Solr cores that better support 
Canada's two official languages.
